# Database

## Entity Relationship Diagram:
#### An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system. ER Diagrams are most often used to design or debug relational databases.ERDs or ER Models use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships and their attributes.

### Example: 
#### The Entity Relationship Diagram below illustrates how the “entities”, in this instance or scenario; student, module, course, department, etc., relate to each other within a system.

## SQL
#### The SQL Database is essentially a structural layout based around the ERD example, though it is not fully completed it shows the basis in which what would be done to fully complete the database as the functional areas are integrated but no information fed into the tables, with the table insert fucntion needing duplication and actual information to fill, store and display information in the tables.
