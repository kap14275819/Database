# Database

## Entity Relationship Diagram:
#### An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system. ER Diagrams are most often used to design or debug relational databases.ERDs or ER Models use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships and their attributes.

## Data Dictionary:
#### Data dictionaries allow viewers to understand the type of input the database will have, for example some areas in the data dictionary will have "text" next to them whereas other will have "float". This is there so that it can indicate whether there will be some type of text within that area or a numerical value. Data dictionaries are important as they can keep the database consistent from the start by giving it a set point as it allows viewers to look onto a clear view of what the database is going to be like and can always be referred back to when stuck.

#### This data dictionary shows how my database will consist of and what value types it will also have within the database. Using a spreadsheet this will help me in having a layout of that database. This will be helpful in case i mistakenly add an extra value within the database so i can refer back to it to avoid any complications that could occur.

## SQL
#### The SQL Database is essentially a structural layout based around the ERD example, though it is not fully completed it shows the basis in which what would be done to fully complete the database as the functional areas are integrated but no information fed into the tables, with the table insert fucntion needing duplication and actual information to fill, store and display information in the tables.
